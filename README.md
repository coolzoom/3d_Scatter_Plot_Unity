# 3d_Scatter_Plot_Unity
A Dataset in .csv format reading scatter plot made in Unity
Designed to use the minimal amount of RAM and GPU.
The idea was to plot directly from reading, but due to design constraints. The designer had to make do.

Controls are the same with Unity Default Control.
Ability to make the points contract and expand depending on the user's wishes would be good
